This is an issue tracker project implemented with the stack Nextjs, Prisma and TailwindCSS

Some of the libraries used in the project are
- Nextjs
- Prisma ORM
- TailwindCSS
- React Hook Form
- and more

This is a project that aims to simplify issue tracking when working with a team. Work in progress

Features that I want to build in this project
- [ ] Issues management
- [ ] Projects
- [ ] Role based access control(maybe even with fine grained permission control)
- [ ] CRUD
- [ ] Notifications(Ping notifications[@username], issues notifications)
- [ ] Kanban board support
- [ ] Excalidraw support

This is an idealitic list but hopefully I can create these features in a couple weeks.
